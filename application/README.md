# Application

A prototype application for [SenseTive](http://sensetive.se), a monitoring system for reducing the risk of stillbirths. 

The application supports authentication of the user, creating "virtual" readings, showing details of a reading 
and editing the user account. The readings are "virtual" since the sensor-kit which the application co-operates 
with is still under development. The application is however prepared for the integration with the sensor-kit.
